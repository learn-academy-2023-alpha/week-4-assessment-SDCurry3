# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
***been in a real bad funk this weekend. Don't quite have the gumption to spend as long as usual on these, apologies.***
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object Oriented Programming refers to treating as much data as possible as an object, packaging and manipulating it as such. whereas functional programming seems a bit more spread out, manipulating data more on its own through separate functions.

Researched answer: Supposedly functional programming is great for 'static' sets of data, where the expected output should be largely the same every time.

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float has a decimal, an integer is a whole number.

Researched answer: integers are also easier for Ruby to chew on, due to the way they are stored in memory as whole chunks of binary as opposed to fractions. Also simpler to divide.
**what on earth is a binary fraction? how can you make a fraction of a zero? nevermind don't tell me, my head hurts already.**

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Means what it says. Return statements in ruby functions are like driving an automatic transmission car, does the thinking for you. automatically returns the last bit of whatever operation the method is doing.
**Yes, I am that snob that drives stick on purpose. Makes the driver pay more attention to what's going on, and is so uncommon these days that it's an actual theft deterrent.**
Researched answer: ***it's 2AM on monday morning, I'm done researching this stuff.***

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: a Block in Ruby is like a function in Javascript, if javascript functions were a bit more like methods

Researched answer: apart from syntax differences, they really do seem quite similar.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: Can't remember. Hashes are basically like Javascript objects so likely done in a similar fashion.
***can't see hash without thinking of hash browns, and now I remember that I haven't eaten today...***
Researched answer: you can extract a value from a hash using the square bracket notation [] or the fetch method.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting all of its properties and behaviors.
*quack*

2. RSpec: It's jest for ruby.
**ugh...**

3. CRUD:  I took notes:   
    Create: Adding new data to a database.
    Read:   Retrieving existing data from the database.
    Update: Modifying existing data in the database.
    Delete: Removing data from the database.
    ***apparently landing a gig maintaining one of these is a pretty cushy spot. full weeks pay for ~10hrs of work.***

4. Test-driven development: Fail before you even start! Write as little code as possible untill you pass! Pray the test is robust enough to not introduce buggy code and send it!
***roundabout method of programming that may be useful in more complex operations or for debugging but currently feels like it just bogs everything down with extra steps. Good habit to get into since it's used a lot for AGILE-style workflows, I understand.***

5. HTTP: Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol: The rotary telephone of transfer protocols. We started switching to HTTPS a few years ago when big internet got spooked about running out of the old ones, and to make things more secure (that's what the S stands for).
***I kinda miss rotary phones. My grandparents had one in their kitchen when I was smol, first phone I ever dialed.***
